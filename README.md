This project is still under development, in conjunction with `hotelmart-api` using MERN stack to provide a shopping service.

The goal here is to establish a convenient platform for shoppers, either visiting or living in a hotel,
who would like to buy the registered products which the guests really enjoy in the hotel room.

Also, the database collects the data for future analytics to innovate the hotel service and revamp the design.
